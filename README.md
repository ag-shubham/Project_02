## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ag-shubham/Project_02.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Project_02
    ```

3. Navigate to both the frontend and backend directories and install the necessary node modules separately:

    ```bash
    # Inside the frontend directory
    cd frontend
    npm install

    # Inside the backend directory
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and connect to your own MongoDB database, and make up your own JWT_SECRET. 

5. Run the project:

    - **Backend:**
      - Use `nodemon` for automatic server restarts during development:
      
        ```bash
        cd backend
        nodemon index.js
        ```
      - Alternatively, without `nodemon`:

        ```bash
        cd backend
        node index.js
        ```

    - **Frontend:**
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm start
      ```
